# Intro-to-QML
 
This is the repo for the introduction to QML course on Qt Academy.


## Getting Started
- Navigate to the **00-Syntax** folder and open the `CMakeLists.txt` file with Qt Creator. You will be greeted with an empty `Hello World` application based on an example seen in the course.
- We will use multiple projects through, don't worry we will guid you to the examples!
- We will explore the structure of QML documents and elements in different contexts.

## Instructions
To get started with this project, you will need to have Qt Creator installed on your computer. You can download Qt Creator from the [Qt.io website](qt.io).


Once you have Qt Creator installed, open the `00-Syntac` folder in Qt Creator. You can do this by opening Qt Creator selecting File > Open File or Project, and then navigating to the folder.
Running the Application
 
To run the application, simply build and run the project in Qt Creator. The application will launch and you will see a blank window with the header "Hello World".
