# Intro-to-QML
 
This is the repo for part 1 of the introduction to QML course on Qt Academy.


## Getting Started
The repo contains 2 sections:
- **00-Start**
    - Navigate to this folder and open the `CMakeLists.txt` file with Qt Creator. You will be greeted with an empty `Hello World` application based on examples seen previously in the course.
    - We will use this project and the `main.qml` file as our plaground to explore the structure of QML documents and elements.
- **01-End**
    - This is the project you should end up with at the end of course.
    - Check it out if you want to dive into the `main.qml` with code comments.

## Instructions
To get started with this project, you will need to have Qt Creator installed on your computer. You can download Qt Creator from the [Qt.io website](qt.io).


Once you have Qt Creator installed, open the `00-Start` folder in Qt Creator. You can do this by opening Qt Creator and selecting File > Open File or Project, and then navigation to the folder.
Running the Application
 
To run the application, simply build and run the project in Qt Creator. The application will launch and you will see a simple GUI with a button and a label.
